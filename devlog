Today, there will be many commits. The work can be broken down 
into three big tasks: 
1.) Connect the the signup component to the authentication microservice
    via axios async calls. 
    To do this, I need to incorporate Redux and React-Redux into the app
2.) Connect the draftdeck component to the recommendations microservice
    via axois async calls. 
3) Add functionality to the thoughtTree: make nodes editable, format 
    label, add buttons for centering when panel is open. 
    Add click-and-drag node creation functionality.
